> Functional Component + Store + Scoped Style 

* Functional style but non-functional programming
* Structure-Style-Behavior Separation
* Hyperscript is visually more friendly
* Each component can have a store and be de-centralized
* Stores of each component can rely on global stores and be centralized
* Each component store has an update method that executes the method to customize local refresh components


## Develop

``` bash
